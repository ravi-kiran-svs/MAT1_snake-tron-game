# SNAKE TRON GAME

This is a 2 player reimagination of the classic Snake game.

**Player 1** :  *Red* snake = move with **WSAD**
**Player 2** : *Blue* snake = move with **Arrow keys**

**Screen Wrapping** : Snakes can pass through the edges and appear on the other side.

**Food** : *GREEN CIRCLES* = eating them increases the size of the snake and score.

**Game Over** : Snake biting itself or the opponent snake loses the game.

## POWER UPS
**Score Multiplier **: *YELLOW DIAMOND* = 2x score
**Shield           **: *BLUE   DIAMOND* = no death + biting leads to the snake cutting off
**Speed Booster    **: *RED    CROSS  * = 2x speed

## WINNING STRATEGY
1. Prioritize increasing the length of your snake.
2. Use shield power up to cut the opponent snake and reduce its length.
3. Circle around the opponent and kill it.
